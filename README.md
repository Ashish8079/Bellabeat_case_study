Summery of case study

*About 51% of people are highly active on average steps, but none of them meet the weekly goal of 8000 steps and 8 hours of sleep, which is unhealthy
* People are less active and walk less in the morning, which is also a poor lifestyle choice.
* As people increase their steps, they also burn more calories. Most of the users use their device frequently on a daily basis.
